# Utility
A repo for little bits of programs I'm tired of re-writing.

## Purpose
A lot of my little coding experiments revolve around some of the same tasks:
 - Parse a CSV
 - Parse whitespace separated data
 - Manage files
 - etc.

I have ended up writing these way too many times (one could argue twice is too many), so I want a place to make and store some generalized code for use later. There are a few reasons why I'm not using pre-existing packages as much as I could:
 - Right now I'm a lot more interested in learning programming, and I don't learn as much just splicing a package into my project.
 - A lot of packages are way heavier than I'd like for my use. I often don't want all the features, I don't want it setup for Maven or running on Node, I just want a lightweight and simple bit of code to call. 
 - My hubris knows no bounds and I foolishly think I can do it better.

## Usage
Each folder will have individual documentation, as well as documentation in each file detailing usage. Wherever possible, solutions will be relatively self contained for easy implementation in other code. Please read documentation for anything in this repo, as there may be certain shortcuts taken to keep the code light and fast.
